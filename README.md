# Cogs

### Falx

Your favorite guild manager.
If you want to know where your bot is, where you want your bot to be invited, or just want to look cool with this cog, well you can without having to open Discord's Developers tabs!
It acts as a whitelist only, you add a guild with a reason and done!
When your bot leave the guild, it gets removed from the whitelist or not if you want to, it's all up to you! Ideal to manage where your bot will be and working with a team.

## Additional Note

I am not planning to approve this repository to Cog-Creators, I do not want to for now, and I do not ever plan to.
