# Falx - Automatic Guild Whitelist

Your favorite guild manager.
If you want to know where your bot is, where you want your bot to be invited, or just want to look cool with this cog, well you can without having to open Discord's Developers tabs!
It acts as a whitelist only, you add a guild with a reason and done!
When your bot leave the guild, it gets removed from the whitelist or not if you want to, it's all up to you! Ideal to manage where your bot will be and working with a team.

## Advantages

- Control where your bot will be.
- Add reasons to manage the bots with co-owners.
- Be alerted when your bot joins/leaves a guild, and if he left or not.

## Disadvantage

- Bot can be added when offline.
- Can use ressources even when not staying in guild. (Other cogs can be using listeners)
